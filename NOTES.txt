NOTES:
	-Remove any hungarian notation. if you must specify that a member variable is indeed a member, do not use the notation
	mSomething
	instead, use the notation
	this->something

Event Managerment:
	Currently, all events are processed as soon as they are recieved, maybe have an event queue to handle events async

TODO:
	Implement debug mode controlled by command line flag
	Have function in luaInterface to check for incorrect EIDS
	Added debug boolean in LEngine.lua

	INPUT:
		Enable mouse support
		Enable actions to be re-bound

	GUI:
		Can use perspective matrix with gui... can be used to achieve interesting effects?
			Either way, instead of generating the matrix every frame (when it's currently constant anyway)
			Store it somewhere and read from it
		Implement buttons that support mouse/keyboard navigation
		Input remapping gui	
		Implement Sprites and Sprite Buttons

	BUGS:
