========
Linearity vs Openness
========
Any given stage must choose be either
	linear and expect perfect platorming
	open and be designed for exploration
	
===
LINEAR
===
One clear path through the stage
Shortcuts and Hidden secrets just off the main path are ok when used sparingly
Focus is on speed runs / time trial
Think Ryman Origins / Crash
If score is used as a goal, time bonus cannot be used to give points (otherwise there's really no difference between time trial and score attack)
Extra points for using a variety of moves?

GOALS:
	Time trial
	Clear without harming enemies
	Score(?)
	smash all boxes(?)

===
OPEN
===
Multiple paths / height levels (a la 2d sonic)
Designed to be explored / played around in
Switch on one side of the map can be used to trigger a button on the other
Each stage will have a 'misison' to complete

Think Mario64 / Rareware

GOALS:
	Find emerald pieces
	Complete 'mission' one per stage
	finish stage
	Get 100 Coins(?)


==
DEATH
==
limited number of lives on exploration stages
When player dies, they pop back at the spawn point with the stage exactly as it was
Can be used to teleport and cut down on time
